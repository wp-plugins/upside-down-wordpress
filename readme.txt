This plugin allows you to "flip" your entire WordPress blog

== Description ==

This plugin allows to "flip" your entire WordPress blog. It will not affect your database in any way. It's made just for the lulz, I guess it can be a really great April Fool's Day joke.

== Installation ==

Just activate the plugin and your whole blog will be "flipped". There is no control panel, at least for the moment. When you're done with it and had enough lulz, just deactivate it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin doesn't seem to work. Do I need anything special in my theme? =

Yes, your theme must have a call to `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` at the very bottom right before the `</body>` tag.
